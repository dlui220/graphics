*** Bresenham's Line Algorithm
**** y = mx + b
**** y = [delta(y) / delta(x)]x + b
**** y*delta(x) = x*delta(y) + b*delta(x)
***** multiply by delta(x)
**** 0 = x*delta(y) - y*delta(x) + b*delta(x)
***** A = delta(y)
***** B = -delta(x)
***** C = b*(delta(x))
**** 0 = Ax + By + C
**** f(x,y) = Ax + By + C
*****       = 0 -> (x,y) is on the line
*****       < 0 -> (x,y) is above the line
*****       > 0 -> (x,y) is below the line


**** Assume first octant
**** f(x+1,y+1/2) = 0 midpoint is on the line, either point is ok
***** < 0 mp is above, draw (x+1,y)
***** > mp is below, draw (x+1, y+1)
